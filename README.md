### Hi there I'm James ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a final year Cyber Security student at the Univeristy of Plymouth. I have an extensive knowledge of networking and have been working towards the Cisco CCNA Certification for a few years. During my studies I have learnt many different programming languages such as C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, CSS & HTML. At present I am currently learning Python to better understand Software Defined Networking.

Please feel free to take a look my repositories :smiley:
